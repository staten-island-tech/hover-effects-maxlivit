            <h1>Hover Boards</h1>
            <p class="first-text"> Hoverboard refers to a recreational vehicle similar to a skateboard in size and shape. Sometimes called a self-balancing scooter, a true hoverboard does not actually hover or float. Instead, a hoverboard has two large wheels separated by a long board, is powered by battery and electricity, and allows riders to move across the ground without pedalling or pushing off with their feet. </p>

            <h1>Hummingbird</h1>
            <p class="first-text"> They are known as hummingbirds because of the humming sound created by their beating wings, which flap at high frequencies audible to humans. They hover in mid-air at rapid wing-flapping rates, which vary from around 12 beats per second in the largest species, to in excess of 80 in some of the smallest. </p>

            <h1>Helicopter</h1>
            <p class="first-text"> A helicopter is a type of rotorcraft in which lift and thrust are supplied by horizontally-spinning rotors. This allows the helicopter to take off and land vertically, to hover, and to fly forward, backward and laterally. These attributes allow helicopters to be used in congested or isolated areas where fixed-wing aircraft and many forms of VTOL (Vertical TakeOff and Landing) aircraft cannot perform. </p>
